    <p><h3>Ingredients </h3>

       <strong>Egg Rolls</strong>
        <ul>8 oz cooked white crab meat</ul>
        <ul>4 oz organic cream cheese</ul>
        <ul>3 spring onions, finely sliced</ul>
        <ul>½ tsp garlic powder</ul>
        <ul>Sea Salt</ul>
        <ul>White pepper</ul>
        <ul>Vietnamese rice paper squares</ul> 
        <ul>Oil, for deep frying</ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Sauce</strong>
        <ul>1/4 cup soy sauce</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon sesame oil</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</ul>
        <ul>Sesame seeds, for garnish</ul>
        <ul>Red pepper flakes, for garnish</ul>
    </p>
        <br>
        <br>
       <p> <strong>Instructions</strong>
         <br>
        <ol>Combine the crab meat with cream cheese, spring onions, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl. Season well with salt and white pepper. </ol>
        <ol>Trim the rice paper squares into suitable squares (ours were 8.5 x 8.5 in, so we cut each one into 4 smaller squares, approx. 4 x 4 in each) and dip into a bowl of warm water – one at a time - as per the packet instructions.</ol>  
        <ol> Scoop a small amount of the crab mixture onto the lower half of the softened rice paper and tuck in the two sides. Roll the rice paper as you would when making a wrap or a spring roll and set aside. Repeat with the remaining mixture until you have made 16.</ol>
